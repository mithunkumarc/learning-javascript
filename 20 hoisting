hoisting : In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.


'use strict';
x = 10;
var x;
>>> 10


Variables and constants declared with let or const are not hoisted!

'use strict';
y = 10;
let y;
>>> Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined



'use strict''
z = 10;
const z;
>>> Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
