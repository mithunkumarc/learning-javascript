#### Map

      ECMAScript 2015 introduces a new data structure to map values to values.
      A Map object is a simple key/value map and can iterate its elements in insertion order(same as inserted).

        let sayings = new Map();
        sayings.set('dog', 'woof');
        sayings.set('cat', 'meow');
        sayings.set('elephant', 'toot');
        console.log(sayings.size); // 3
        console.log(sayings); // [Array[2], Array[2], Array[2]]
        console.log('value for fox ',sayings.get('fox')); // undefined , doesn't exists
        sayings.has('bird'); // false
        sayings.delete('dog');
        console.log('has dog? ',sayings.has('dog')); // false

        // looping map using iterator
        let it = sayings.entries();
        let result = it.next();
        while (!result.done) {
         console.log(result.value[0],':',result.value[1]); 
         result = it.next();
        }

#### The Difference Between Arrays and Objects

        In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
        In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

        Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.

#### when to use map and object


        Use maps over objects when keys are unknown until run time, 
        and when all keys are the same type and all values are the same type.


        Use maps if there is a need to store primitive values as keys 
        because object treats each key as a string whether it's a number value, boolean value or any other primitive value.

        eg : map.set(1,"ranjan") //obj treats key 1 as string


        Use objects when there is logic that operates on individual elements.
        eg: behavior of objects

#### weakmap : similar to weakreference in python, helpful for tracking obj which are eligible for garbage collection.


        The WeakMap object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are objects only and the values can be arbitrary values. 
        The object references in the keys are held weakly, 
        meaning that they are a target of garbage collection (GC) if there is no other reference to the object anymore. 
        The WeakMap API is the same as the Map API.

        One difference to Map objects is that WeakMap keys are not enumerable
        (i.e., there is no method giving you a list of the keys). 
        If they were, the list would depend on the state of garbage collection, introducing non-determinism.

#### Set : similar to java , unique elements. unless java, javascript maintain order of elements.

          Set objects are collections of values. 
          You can iterate its elements in insertion order. 
          A value in a Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.

          eg:

          var mySet = new Set();
          mySet.add(1);
          mySet.add('some text');
          mySet.add('foo');

          mySet.has(1); // true
          mySet.delete('foo');
          mySet.size; // 2

          for (let item of mySet) console.log(item);
          // 1
          // "some text"

#### conversion between array and set

        var mySet = new Set();
        mySet.add(1);
        mySet.add(2);
        mySet.add(3);
        mySet.add(4);


        Array.from(mySet);
        a = [...mySet];   //converting from set to array 
        console.log(a.length);


        mySet2 = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4]);


        Note : array allows duplicates whereas set doesn't
        mySet2 = new Set([2,2,2,2]);
        >>> mySet2.size
        >>> 1
