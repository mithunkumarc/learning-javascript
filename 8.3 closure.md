#### closure : example : (can be used to make data(variable)/function/private)

        incrementing counter on click a button. 
        if count is a global variable , any other function can access this variable and modify its state.

        so this problem can be solved by closure. 
        count variable made a variable of outerfunction and returning inner function by incrementing count value.
        when outer funtion is called , returned is incremented value not count variable itself.


#### bad idea : any one can update count value

        var counter = 0;//global variable another function may use this

        function updateClickCount() {
            ++counter;
            // do something with counter
        }

#### good idea : count is hidden

        function updateCounter(){
          let count = 0;
          return function incrementCounter(){
            return count++;
          }
        }

        //no one can access count variable but they can read incremented value of count variable
        let counter = updateCounter(); 
        
        counter()
        //0
        counter()
        //1
        counter()
        //2
