‘this’ keyword is famous in Javascript which confuses lots of developers.

self used as a variable such var self = this;
usually you’d do this to access ‘this’ keyword inside another inner function,
and there’s actual ‘self’ keyword when we’re using Web Worker to do some heaving computation outside the main thread,
so the workers don’t expose ‘this’ keyword, so we have to use ‘self’ keyword instead, 
but bear in mind that ‘self’ has less methods than ‘this’ keyword.

inner function cannot access this 



        var account = {
          id: 45456,
          balance: 200,
          deduct: function(amount) {
            var self = this; // if u miss this, balance will print 200
            var a = function(val) {
              self.balance -= val;
            };

            a(amount);
          }
        };

        account.deduct(100);
        console.log(account.balance); //Now it reads 100. Phew.

#### Arrow functions do NOT have their own this.

Regular function:

        const obj = {
          name: "Cat",
          speak() {
            console.log(this.name); // "Cat"
          }
        };

        obj.speak(); 
Works because this is bound to obj.  

An arrow function inherits this from the surrounding (lexical) scope.
A regular function gets its this from how it is called.
        
        const obj = {
          name: "Cat",
          speak: () => {
            console.log(this.name); // NOT "Cat"
          }
        };
        obj.speak();

➡️ this does NOT refer to obj here.
Instead, it refers to whatever this was outside the object when it was created (often the global object in browsers).

#### Arrow functions are great for callbacks

Example: Inside a class or object method:

        function Timer() {
          this.seconds = 0;
        
          setInterval(() => {
            this.seconds++;
          }, 1000);
        }

The arrow function keeps the this of Timer, so it works.


#### 2. ❌ Arrow functions should NOT be used as object methods

Because they can’t bind this to the object.

#### 3. ❌ Arrow functions cannot be constructors

        const Cat = () => {};
        new Cat(); // TypeError


| Feature                            | Arrow Function | Regular Function |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Own `this`?                        | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes            |
| `this` depends on how it's called? | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes            |
| Good for methods?                  | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes            |
| Good for callbacks?                | ✅ Yes          | 😐 Sometimes     |
| Usable as constructor?             | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes            |
