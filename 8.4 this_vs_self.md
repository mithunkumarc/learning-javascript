‘this’ keyword is famous in Javascript which confuses lots of developers.

self used as a variable such var self = this;
usually you’d do this to access ‘this’ keyword inside another inner function,
and there’s actual ‘self’ keyword when we’re using Web Worker to do some heaving computation outside the main thread,
so the workers don’t expose ‘this’ keyword, so we have to use ‘self’ keyword instead, 
but bear in mind that ‘self’ has less methods than ‘this’ keyword.

inner function cannot access this 



        var account = {
          id: 45456,
          balance: 200,
          deduct: function(amount) {
            var self = this; // if u miss this, balance will print 200
            var a = function(val) {
              self.balance -= val;
            };

            a(amount);
          }
        };

        account.deduct(100);
        console.log(account.balance); //Now it reads 100. Phew.
