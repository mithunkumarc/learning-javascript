each object has an internal property called __proto__
__proto__ contains inherited properties from prototype.

creating animal constructor which also acts as prototype for objects which are created from animal
function animal(name,age){
	this.name = name;
	this.age = age;
}

let dog = new animal('dog',2);     //dog will get properties from animal constructor function/prototype, and __proto__ from Object
>>> dog

let cat = new animal('cat',1);


if you want to add new propterty to dog and cat, add new property to prototype , this property will reflect in all objects
which are created from animal constructor function.

animal.prototype.color = 'white';

check dog and cat , you will find color property in __proto__ internal property

dog.color 
>>> white

cat.color
>>> white
