ducktype : if something behaves like duck treat as duck even though its not a duck.
object as array : if object behaves as array so treat this object as array, access properties using key(i.e index)

object can be used as array
var obj = {
	1:10,
	2:20,
	3:30,
	length:4
}

obj
{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, length: 4}
typeof obj
"object"

//object behaving like array, in array you cannot use index as property
obj.1
output :  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected number

//access value through index, so object behaving like array
obj[1]
10
