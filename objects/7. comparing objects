In JavaScript objects are a reference type. 

Two distinct objects are never equal, even if they have the same properties. 

Only comparing the same object reference with itself yields true.

// Two variables, two distinct objects with the same properties
var fruit = {name: 'apple'};
var fruitbear = {name: 'apple'};

fruit == fruitbear; // return false
fruit === fruitbear; // return false

// Two variables, a single object
var fruit = {name: 'apple'};
var fruitbear = fruit;  // assign fruit object reference to fruitbear

// here fruit and fruitbear are pointing to same object
fruit == fruitbear; // return true
fruit === fruitbear; // return true
