Offsets are used for spacing elements in the responsive grid.

The unit is based on the column layout.

You can define an offset this way : col-[breakpoint]-offset-[number of colums]

In this example, admitting our layout is made of 12 columns :

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        <p>test</p>
    </div>
</div>
Means that in the medium range of the grid system, the element will have a width of 6 colums and there will be 3 blank columns before the element (and as a consequence, will have 3 blank colums after).

The result of this is a div of 6 colums width, centered in the container.

There is a example showing how it renders in the Bootstrap documentation. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/#offsetting-columns
