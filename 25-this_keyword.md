The this keyword behaves differently in JavaScript compared to other languages.  

In JavaScript the value of this not refer to the function in which it is used or itâ€™s scope but is 
determined mostly by the invocation context of function (context.function()) and where it is called.


        function foo() {
          var a = 2;
          bar();
        }
        function bar(){
          console.log(this.a);
        }
        foo();// undefined
        // foo is looking a at global scope (window)
