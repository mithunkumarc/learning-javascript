### "__ proto __" : property of an object, contains list of properties inherited from prototype(parent) object

### like java, javascript also has topmost object called Object. (javascript is Object based programming language)

### prototype(Object prototype) : source from which object being created, available on function (used as constructor)


### function used as constructor

    function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
        this.firstName = first;
        this.lastName = last;
        this.age = age;
        this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
    }

    Note : Person function has attribute called prototype
            you can use this attribute to add new property
            Person.prototye.<add_new_property> = value
            adding new property here will be inherited to all obects created by this function
        
#### Object created using function

    var arun = new Person("arun", "kumar" , 22, "black");
    
    Note : arun has a property call __proto__ (which points to function constructor prototype)
           you can use this __proto__ to add new property 
            this property will be inherited to all objects created by Person function
            
#### conclusion : 


        arun object inherits propeties from Person.prototype (not function constructor)


#### Note : 

        Person prototype makes sures that arun will inherit properties from Person.

        expand arun object in console, 
        arun will have __proto__ property, expand __proto__ property , you will find Person properties.

        Note : 
         Person.prototype.nationality = "English"; 
         use prototype keyword to add properties , it will reflect in all child objects of Person prototype.


        >>arun.nationality
        "English"


        *****************************
        another example : 

        #Foo is prototype, decides what properties a child object of Foo can have
        function Foo(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }

        var b = new Foo('b');
        var a = new Foo('a');
        b.say = function() {
          console.log('Hi from ' + this.whoAmI());
        }

        //both a.__proto__ and Foo.prototype has only property called name, returns true
        console.log(a.__proto__ === Foo.prototype); // true
        //a and b share same properties from Foo so true
        console.log(a.__proto__ === b.__proto__); // true
